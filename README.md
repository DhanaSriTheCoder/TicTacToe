This repository contains a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and Tkinter. The game initializes a 3x3 grid of buttons, alternating between "X" and "O" as players take turns. It checks for a winner or a draw after each move and displays the result using message boxes. The game runs through Tkinter's main loop, providing an interactive graphical interface for a classic two-player experience.
